# Exercise 4: Adding `mocha` and `chai`

When we originally ran the `wdio` command to generate our config file, we chose `mocha` as the framework for organizing our tests.

## Success criteria

1. Learn the main difference between `sync` modes
1. Learn how to use mocha to group our tests appropriately.
1. Install `chai` and learn to use `expect()` for assertions.

## Instructions

### Init the exercise

1. Change to the correct directory

```bash
cd exercise-4
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Switch to sync mode

Back when we first created our `wdio.conf.js` file, we set `sync` mode to `false` so we could reuse some of our first test code.  It returned a promise with a `.then()` which called `assert()` to validate the test.

However, WebDriver.io can do a cool trick where we enable `sync` mode to `true`, and it will handle a lot of the _asynchronous_ nature of browser testing for us, and allow us to write more readable code that looks more _synchronous_.

You can read more about it in the official documentation, [It's all synchronous](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/v4.html#It%E2%80%99s-all-synchronous).

_An example from the WebDriver.io docs of code that looks more synchronous, without any promises:_

```js
// Notice the lack of return statements and `.then()`?
describe('webdriver.io page', function() {
    it('should have the right title', function () {
        // Navigate
        browser.url('/');

        // Get the page's title
        var title = browser.getTitle();

        // Assert the page title is what we expect it to be
        assert.equal(title, 'WebdriverIO - WebDriver bindings for Node.js');
    });
});
```

> **Important:** "All commands now block the execution of the test process until theyâ€™ve resolved. No then calls have to be done anymore, we can just assign the direct response of the Selenium server to a variable."

### Enable `sync` mode

_Because it makes everything appear cleaner and more readable!_

1. In `wdio.conf.js`, change `sync` back to `true`:

```js
// ...
sync: true,
// ...
```

### Using Mocha

Mocha is already included in your project when you installed `wdio`.  But we do need to update our code to use it.

1. We need to change the code from returning a promise _(async style)_, to a handful of separate statements that will execute one after another _(sync style)_.

Open the `exercise-4/tests/browser/example.spec.js` test file, and replace it with the following code:

```js
/**
 * example.spec.js
 */
var assert = require('assert');

describe('Example using Node\'s assertion library', function () {
    describe('page title', function () {
        var expectedPageTitle = "Verbo - Simple travel planning";

        it('should be "' + expectedPageTitle + '"', function () {
            // Navigate to the home page
            browser.url('/');

            // Get the page title
            var pageTitle = browser.getTitle();

            // Log the page title (just for fun)
            console.log('\nðŸ¤– The page title is: ' + pageTitle);

            // Assert the page title is what we expect it to be
            assert.equal(pageTitle, expectedPageTitle);

            // HINT: Want to see what a failure looks like?
            //       Uncomment the line below to try the `.notEqual()` syntax!
            // assert.notEqual(pageTitle, expectedPageTitle);

            // HINT: You can also change the page title in `verbo/public/index.html` to simulate an actual bug in the code, which should also cause your test to fail.
        });
    });
});
```

_Look Ma, no promises!_  We're simply using Node's built-in `assert` module, and our test runner will tell us if any of our assertions fail.

3. Run it

```bash
npm run test:browser
```

You should see the example spec run with 1 passing test, and the page title printed to the console:

### Adding `chai`

Chai enables much more powerful assertions via multiple styles, and for this workshop we'll use `expect()`.

_**Side note:** Chai's `should()` syntax has some gotchas, as explained in the [official docs](http://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should).  This is why we'll use `expect()`._

1. Install `chai` as a `devDependency`:

```bash
npm i --save-dev chai
```

2. Create a new file called `example-chai.spec.js`, and paste the following code:

```js
var expect = require('chai').expect;

describe('Example using Chai\'s assertion library', function () {
    describe('page title', function () {
        var expectedPageTitle = "Verbo - Simple travel planning";

        it('should be "' + expectedPageTitle + '"', function () {
            // Navigate to the home page
            browser.url('/');

            // Get the page title
            var pageTitle = browser.getTitle();

            // Log the page title (just for fun)
            console.log('\nðŸ¤– (Chai) The page title is: ' + pageTitle);

            // Assert the page title is what we expect it to be
            expect(pageTitle).to.equal(expectedPageTitle);

            // HINT: Want to see what a failure looks like?  
            //       Uncomment the line below to try the `.not.to.equal()` syntax!
            // expect(pageTitle).not.to.equal(expectedPageTitle);

            // HINT: You can also change the page title in `verbo/public/index.html` to simulate an actual bug in the code, which should also cause your test to fail.
        });
    });
});
```

The above simply changes from the Node.js `assert` module to using Chai's, which is much more powerful.

### Expect the homepage's h1 text to be correct

For extra practice, let's add another inner `describe()` block within the outermost `describe()` block ... you'll then have two "sub-groups" of tests within this example group:

- One for `describe('page title')`
- Another for `describe('page h1')`

```js
describe('page h1', function () {
    var expectedH1Text = "Did you remember to pack your toothbrush?";

    it('should be "' + expectedH1Text + '"', function () {
        // Navigate to the home page
        browser.url('/');

        // Get the h1 text
        var h1Text = browser.getText('h1');

        // Log the h1 text (just for fun)
        console.log('\nðŸ¤– (Chai) The h1 text is: ' + h1Text);

        // Assert the h1 text is what we expect it to be
        expect(h1Text).to.equal(expectedH1Text);

        // HINT: Want to see what a failure looks like?  
        //       Uncomment the line below to try the `.not.to.equal()` syntax!
        // expect(h1Text).not.to.equal(expectedH1Text);

        // HINT: You can also change the h1 text in `verbo/src/components/HomePage/HomePage.jsx` to simulate an actual bug in the code, which should also cause your test to fail.
    });
});
```

Run your test script again, and you'll see another passing test!

```bash
npm run test:browser
```

![3 passing tests](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/b2be255c-9dc5-4cae-aeac-32ba61c978a4/2018-05-28_02-53-52.png)

âœ… You've made a lot of progress, great job!

## What we learned

- [x] We learned how to use mocha syntax to group our tests with `describe()` and `it()` functions.
- [x] We learned that setting `sync` mode to `true` allows us to write more simple, synchronous-looking code in our tests, and let WebDriver.io abstract away the inherently async behavior of testing with web browsers.
