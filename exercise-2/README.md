# Exercise 2: Install WebDriver.io and write your first test

Now, let's install WebDriver.io and the [standalone Selenium server]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone)).  We'll need both in order to run our e2e test specs.

These instructions are based heavily on the official [WebDriver.io docs](http://webdriver.io/guide.html), which are really well done.  Get used to using them!

## Success criteria

1. The necessary Selenium and WebDriver tools are installed.
1. Your first automated browser test should run successfully.

## Instructions

In order to run our first test, we'll make sure our example app server is running, install WebDriver.io as a dependency for our e2e test code, and install a standalone Selenium server. _(Luckily, we'll see an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone) which makes this quite simple!)_

> So expect to have a few terminal windows (or tabs) open ðŸ¤“

### Start the app server

Make sure the app server from [exercise-1](../exercise-1) is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

_**Note:** In the future, we'll just assume this app is always running._

### Install the selenium-standalone server

1. Open a new tab in your terminal app.  We'll run the Selenium standalone server in this new shell.

2. Install Selenium standalone server via NPM.  We're going to install it _globally_ so we don't have keep re-installing it for other exercises _(hence the `-g` argument)_.

```bash
npm i -g selenium-standalone
selenium-standalone install --drivers.firefox.version=0.23.0
```

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary><small><strong>TODO:</strong> Update code after selenium-standalone updates Gecko driver</small></summary>
<p>

<em>Once the selenium-standalone package is finally updated to use the [latest Gecko driver](https://github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone/issues/409), the code below should work again without specifying the exact driver version.</em>

```bash
npm i -g selenium-standalone
selenium-standalone install
```
</p>
</details>

&nbsp;

_The install command pulls down its own dependencies and makes it ready to be runnable._

3. Starting the server is simple, and will run in that terminal tab until you stop it with `ctrl-c`.

```bash
selenium-standalone start --drivers.firefox.version=0.23.0
```

<em>Once the selenium-standalone package is finally updated to use the [latest Gecko driver](https://github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone/issues/409), the code below should work again without specifying the exact driver version.</em>

```bash
selenium-standalone start
```
</p>
</details>

&nbsp;

_You should see some output as the server starts, including a line telling you which url & port the server is using:_

Visit your selenium server at [http://localhost:4444/](http://localhost:4444/) to make sure it's working.

![localhost on port 4444](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/5a489917-b390-46a9-af3b-33325f00f116/2018-05-27_13-05-45.png)

### Init the exercise

1. Open a new tab where we'll run test commands
2. Change to the correct directory

```bash
cd exercise-2
```

### Install WebDriver.io via NPM

1. Open a new tab in your terminal, and `cd` into the `exercise-2` directory.  We'll run our actual e2e tests in this shell.

```bash
npm i --save-dev webdriverio
```

> _Learn more about available aliases for [npm i](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).  For example, `-D` is an alias for the `--save-dev` argument._

### Create your first test file

1. Take a look at the application in your code editor.  Notice that in the `exercise-2` folder, I've already scaffolded out an NPM project to save some time, along with an empty `src` folder to give you a better idea of how this might work within your own applications.  

_Our e2e tests using WebDriver are typically installed and run in the same NPM project as our app when out in the wild._

2. From the official [WebDriver docs](http://webdriver.io/guide.html), let's copy their example test code.  Create a new file in the `tests/browser` directory called `example.spec.js` and copy the following into it:

```js
var webdriverio = require('webdriverio');
var options = {
    desiredCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'firefox'
    }
};

webdriverio
    .remote(options)
    .init()
    .url('http://www.google.com')
    .getTitle().then(function(title) {
        console.log('Title was: ' + title);
    })
    .end()
    .catch(function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    });
```

_Note that `*.spec.js` is the standard file name format for executable test specs.  [Learn more](http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/organizesuite.html#Group-Test-Specs)_

3. Save the file.

### Run the test

Let's see how we did ...

```bash
cd tests/browser
node example.spec.js
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```bash
$ node example.spec.js
Title was: Google
```

_Nice job, you've just created your first automated test!_

### Let's get fancier

When that first example ran, you should've seen a Firefox browser window open in the background _(make sure your other app windows aren't full-screen)_, load up Google, and get the title of the window.

This time, let's change our configuration object to specify Chrome as our browser for automated testing, and also point our script at our running example application on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

1. Open up `example.spec.js` and change the `options.desiredCapabilities.browserName` to `'chrome'`:

```js
var options = {
    desiredCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'chrome'
    }
};
```

2. Change the url to our local application:

```js
.url('http://localhost:3000')
```

3. After the `getTitle()` call, add another line to log the url to the console:

```js
// getTitle() ...
.getUrl().then(function (url) { // gets the page url, and executes a callback fn in .then()
    console.log('Url was: ' + url);
})
```

4. And for fun, let's use a standard CSS selector syntax to print out the page's `<h1 />` text:

```js
// getTitle() ...
// getUrl() ...
.getText('h1').then(function (text) { // gets the page's h1 element text
    console.log('h1 was: ' + text);
})
```

5. Run the test again, and this time we should see it open up Chrome instead, as well as some new lines in the console output.

```bash
node example.spec.js
```

And here is the output you should expect:

```bash
$ node example.spec.js
Title was: Verbo - Simple travel planning
Url was: http://localhost:3000/
h1 was: Did you remember to pack your toothbrush?
```

âœ… Your first test spec is running swimmingly!
