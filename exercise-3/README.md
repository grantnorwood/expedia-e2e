# Exercise 3: Using the `wdio` test runner

There are two methods of running your WebDriver.io tests, and they are well documented in the official docs called "[Standalone vs WDIO](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/modes.html)".  Standalone mode is fine for first demos, or building your own entire framework, but **using WDIO is the preferred method of running e2e tests at scale.**

> The WDIO Testrunner
> [http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/modes.html#The-WDIO-Testrunner](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/modes.html#The-WDIO-Testrunner)
>
> "The main purpose of WebdriverIO though is end to end testing on big scale. We therefore implemented a test runner that helps you to build a reliable test suite that is easy to read and maintain. The test runner takes care of many problems you are usually facing when working with plain automation libraries.
>
> For one it organizes your test runs and splits up test specs so your tests can be executed with maximum concurrency. It also handles session management and provides a lot of features that help you to debug problems and find errors in your tests."

That being said, we'll use the WDIO test runner from this point forward!

## Success criteria

1. Understand the difference between the standalone mode and using the WDIO test runner.
1. Setup your test runner to use `wdio`, the preferred way to run your e2e tests.
1. Add a convenient `npm` script

## Instructions

### Init the exercise

1. Change to the correct directory

```bash
cd exercise-3
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Using the `wdio` command

The `wdio` package is already installed with `webdriverio`, and available as an executable in the `node_modules` directory.  Let's test that it's working:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/wdio --help
```

If it's working, you'll see the help docs printed to the console:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wdio --help
WebdriverIO CLI runner

Usage: wdio [options] [configFile]
Usage: wdio config
Usage: wdio repl [browserName]
config file defaults to wdio.conf.js
The [options] object will override values from the config file.
An optional list of spec files can be piped to wdio that will override configured specs.

Options:
(...)
```

### Create a configuration file

The `wdio` command can help us setup our initial configuration file by walking us through some questions which will automatically scaffold your tests appropriately.

1. Run the `wdio` command to be asked some questions:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/wdio
```

_**Note:** See the screen shots below.  You'll accept the defaults on many of the questions by simply pressing the `enter` key._

2. When asked where your test specs should be located, let's choose a slightly different path that is more selective about the test spec file globs.

Instead, enter `./tests/browser/**/*.spec.js`:

```bash
Where are your test specs located? (./test/specs/**/*.js) ./tests/browser/**/*.spec.js
```

3. When asked which reporter, choose `dot` reporter.  _(It will be chosen by default if you don't make a selection.)_

4. When asked which services, use the arrow keys and spacebar to scroll and select these options:

![WDIO Configuration Helper - selenium-standalone](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/4672063d-3b63-4e5c-8299-cd050766acc7/2018-05-27_17-04-10.png)

Choosing the `selenium-standalone` service means that we don't have to manually run our Selenium server, `wdio` will automatically start that service up for us.

This also makes running the service more consistent and reliable with multiple developers.

5. Choose `silent` for logging verbosity. _We don't need all the extra noise quite yet._

![silent verbosity](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/9011e770-f075-4272-926e-0e063b8e368b/2018-05-27_17-20-19.png)

6. When asked for the base url, enter our example app's url _(without the trailing slash)_: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### A successful installation

![A successful installation](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/75cbf06d-99ad-4afc-8b27-b0cb687ce333/2018-05-27_17-24-04.png)

And you'll see the new `devDependencies` which were automatically added to your package.json:

```js
"devDependencies": {
  "wdio-dot-reporter": "0.0.10",
  "wdio-mocha-framework": "^0.6.4",
  "wdio-selenium-standalone-service": "0.0.10",
  "webdriverio": "^4.14.0"
}
```

### Customizing the configuration

1. First, let's make sure the correct test files are running.  We'll exclude the solution test file by adding the appropriate path to the `exclude` property:

```js
specs: [
    './tests/browser/**/*.spec.js'
],
// Patterns to exclude.
exclude: [
    './tests/browser/solution/**/*.spec.js'
],
```

_**Note:** If you have problems getting your tests to run in any of the exercises, or simply want to skip ahead, you can change the `specs` path to only run the solution files, as shown below:_

```js
// Only run the solution test files 
specs: [
    // './tests/browser/**/*.spec.js'
    './tests/browser/solution/**/*.spec.js'
],
exclude: [
    // './tests/browser/solution/**/*.spec.js'
],
// ...
```

2. As we did in the previous exercise, let's change the `browserName` default from `firefox` to `chrome`.

Look for the `capabilities` object in your `wdio.conf.js` file:

```js
capabilities: [{
    // maxInstances can get overwritten per capability. So if you have an in-house Selenium
    // grid with only 5 firefox instances available you can make sure that not more than
    // 5 instances get started at a time.
    maxInstances: 5,
    //
    browserName: 'chrome'
}],
```

3. Since our first test spec _(example.spec.js)_ is still using promises, let's `sync` to `false` for now.

```js
// By default WebdriverIO commands are executed in a synchronous way using
// the wdio-sync package. If you still want to run your tests in an async way
// e.g. using promises you can set the sync option to false.
sync: false,
```

### Create a test spec

Create a new test spec file called `example.spec.js` in `exercise-3/tests/browser`, and paste this log statement:

```js

console.log('browser.desiredCapabilities', browser.desiredCapabilities);

```

This where we will eventually see our tests execute, but for now this simply logs the [global `browser` object](http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/browserobject.html) so we know it's working.  It also gives us some insights into the global browser object in WebDriver.io.

### Running `wdio`

We can now execute our `wdio` test runner, though it's not going to give us any passing tests quite yet:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/wdio
```

You should see the `wdio` command execute successfully, using the `wdio.conf.js` file for configuration, executing our `exercise-3/tests/browser/example.spec.js` test file where we've logged some global `browser` info to the console.

![wdio example output](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/07ee0e92-06c4-4713-9c93-d98158dc6097/2018-05-27_21-28-07.png)

Note that none of the tests are passing, because we haven't really created our next set of tests quite yet ...

### First passing test

Next we're going to convert our previous test from example-2 to use `wdio`.

Since `wdio` does much of the setup and teardown of tests, we can delete the `require()` and `options` lines, as well as calls to `.remote()`, `.init()`, and `.end()`.  Additionally, the global WebDriver client is a variable called `browser`, so we'll update that, too.

And because the base url is defined in our configuration file, we can simply point to the root path.  So we'll go ahead and delete those obsolete lines, change `webdriverio` to `browser`, and update the `url`.  You'll also see that we've wrapped the `browser` code in Mocha's `describe()` and `it()` functions so that we see passing tests:

1. Open the existing `tests/browser/example.spec.js` and replace it with the following code _(based on the previous exercise)_:

```js
/**
 * example.spec.js
 */
var assert = require('assert');

describe('Example', function () {
    describe('page title', function () {
        var expectedPageTitle = "Verbo - Simple travel planning";

        it('should be "' + expectedPageTitle + '"', function () {
            // Navigate to the home page.
            return browser
                .url('/')
                .getTitle().then(function (title) {
                    // Log the page title.
                    console.log('ðŸ¤– The page title is: ' + title);

                    // Assert the homepage title is what we expect it to be.
                    assert.equal(title, expectedPageTitle);

                    // Want to see what a failure looks like?  Uncomment the line below to try the `.not` syntax!
                    // assert.notEqual(title, expectedPageTitle);
                });
        });
    });
});
```

2. Run the test again, and you should see something like this, with 1 test passing:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/wdio
```

![1 test passing](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/7d88adaa-80a3-4d22-b349-f40f90613d42/2018-05-27_22-54-31.png)

You can also try intentionally causing a test to fail to see what that looks like.  Uncomment the `assert.notEqual()` statement to see a test failure:

![1 test passing, 1 test failure](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/1cfb91f4-0ead-41f2-8212-173f1ec21d96/2018-05-27_22-53-30.png)

### Launch `wdio` with an `npm` script

Let's add an `npm test` script so we can avoid calling `wdio` directly, and make it easier for other developers and build tools to run your e2e test suite.

You can call your script just about anything, but at HomeAway, we typically have a pattern where a variety of "sub-scripts" use the colons to group similar scripts _(`:`)_.

Also, `npm run test` is more typically used to run unit tests.

1. Open `package.json`
2. Notice the new `scripts` field:

```js
"scripts": {
    "test": "wdio"
},
```

3. Now, simply run `npm test` from now on to run your suite of tests.  Notice the `> wdio` in the output:

![Running npm test](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/2bc13607-f9c7-4af4-aeb2-45b1d8ccb1ff/2018-05-28_02-11-34.png)

**Pro tip:** Another benefit to using `npm` scripts is that they already search `node_modules/.bin` for local executables, so we can simple execute `wdio` without the rest of the path.

âœ… **Congratulations!** With the `wdio` test runner setup, you're getting closer to a fully configured environment for running e2e tests.
